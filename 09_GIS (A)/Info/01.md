.osm and .pbf are both file formats used to store OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, but they differ significantly in structure and
efficiency:

- **.osm files** are XML-based plain text files containing OSM data. They are human-readable but tend to be very large and
  slower to process due to the verbose XML syntax.
- **.pbf files** (Protocolbuffer Binary Format) are a highly compressed, binary version of OSM data. They store the same
  information as .osm files but in a compact, binary format that is about 40-50% smaller in size. This makes .pbf files
  faster to download and process, though not human-readable.
- The .pbf format is the recommended format for efficient data processing, especially for large datasets, as it offers faster
  reading and writing compared to .osm XML files.
- Essentially, the difference is that .osm is XML text, while .pbf is a compressed binary optimized for performance and
  storage, containing the same data but in a more efficient way.[1][2][3][4]

Thus, .pbf is a binary, compressed alternative to the plain-text .osm format, both encoding the same map data.
