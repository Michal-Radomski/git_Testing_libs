The error "Unable to open datasource `wlkp.osm.pbf' with the following drivers" when working with a .osm.pbf file from
Geofabrik usually means that GDAL/ogr2ogr does not have the OSM driver enabled or properly installed to read the PBF format.
Although .osm.pbf files are the standard OpenStreetMap data format and supported by many tools, the ability to read them
directly depends on having GDAL compiled with the OSM and protobuf support.

To resolve this:

1. Make sure you have installed GDAL with OSM and PBF support. On Ubuntu, install gdal-bin and the related libraries:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
   ```
2. Verify the available drivers in your GDAL installation:

   ```
   ogrinfo --formats | grep -i osm
   ```

   You should see the "OSM" driver listed.

3. If the OSM driver is missing, you may need to install GDAL from a repository that includes necessary driver support, such
   as the ubuntugis PPA:

   ```
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install gdal-bin
   ```

4. Alternatively, convert the .osm.pbf file to .osm XML format first using Osmosis or osmconvert tools, then use ogr2ogr on
   the .osm file:
   ```
   osmosis --read-pbf wlkp.osm.pbf --write-xml wlkp.osm
   ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON output.geojson wlkp.osm
   ```

In essence, the error is due to missing or incompatible GDAL/ogr2ogr support for reading .osm.pbf natively, which requires
either proper GDAL installation with OSM driver or a conversion step from PBF to XML OSM before using ogr2ogr.[1][2][3][5]
