The "highway" tag in OpenStreetMap has many possible values representing different types of roads and paths. Some common
highway types include:

- motorway: major highways with controlled access
- trunk: high-importance roads below motorways
- primary, secondary, tertiary: decreasing importance of roads
- residential: streets serving houses
- service: minor service roads
- footway, cycleway, bridleway, path: pedestrian, bicycle, horse, or general paths
- track: minor unpaved roads
- motorway_link, trunk_link, primary_link, etc.: ramp links to main roads
- road: unknown classification (temporary tag)

Besides highways and railways, you can extract many other OSM object types, such as:

- points: points of interest, landmarks, amenities (restaurants, shops)
- buildings: from multipolygon layers
- water features: rivers, lakes (lines, multipolygons)
- land use: parks, forests, residential areas (multipolygons)
- administrative boundaries: for cities, countries
- natural features: cliffs, hills, beaches

Each of these is usually found in different layers like points, lines, multipolygons, or multilinestrings in the OSM .pbf
data.

So, you can filter by "highway" with a wide range of values, or explore other tags depending on what geographic objects you
want to extract beyond transportation features.[1][2][3][10]
